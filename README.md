Cheap Remote Camera

Here is another inexpensive ESP32/ESP8288 microcontroller project.  A few months ago, I bought an ESP32-CAM board.  
It had some bad solder joints that took me a while to fix.  It works fine after repair.  
This little board contains a camera (still and motion), built in flash, 32-bit microcontroller, SD card writer, 
512k + 4M memory, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi for under $7.00. Amazing.

Although this little board has been out for a while the software libraries do not seem very mature.  
To test it out, I wrote a program that takes pictures and stores them in on-board memory or on a ÂµSD card.  
The images can be retrieved using our old friend FTP.  
Pushing a button on a web page created by the microcontroller triggers a picture to be take. 
Of course, I did not have to write the program from scratch.  Examples were available for all major software components. 

This little device could be made into a DIY video doorbell or motion detecting security camera.
